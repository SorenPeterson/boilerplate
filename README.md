Getting Started:
All of the code that is written will be in the src directory. Index.jsx is the entry point for webpack. You should consider this to be your main file and import anything else you need from there, including stylesheets. Scripts and stylesheets will be automatically inject into the html template. Feel free to modify the template however you like.
